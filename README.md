#Makers Academy Challenge Week 5

##The Challenge

Create a game of rock, paper, scissors that can be played in the browser using **Sinatra**.

####Level One

Use the code provided and create a **Sinata** based web app.
>I have added functionality to the existing code, which enables players to
play a game of the 'best out of three' and the game will display the name of the
both players and the winners pick.

####Level Two

The code then has to be deployed to **Heroku** with two seperate staging
deployment targets: staging and production. This means having two
**Heroku** apps that are being deployed to and three **GitHub** remotes
(origin, staging, production).

####Level Three

After deploying to **Heroku**, add **NewRelic** add-on to the
production environment to find out the average page
loading time using **NewRelic's** interface. Write a little about what
can be done with **NewRelic**.

####Bonus

Make the application beautiful!
